        Python LXML object binding.

        What is this?
        -------------
        
        The [xml.etree][1] library is a great way to manipulate XML in Python, but in most domains
        it is clearer to use objects that model your domain entities instead of manipulating
        the XML representation directly. The motivating example was [Jenkins][2] XML job
        configurations, but the same problem is likely to exist for any XML-based modeling.
        
        This project attempts to use Python [data descriptors][3] to bind an element tree
        to Python objects.

        Example
        -------
        
        Assume that you have an API using XML representations of people with first and last names:
        
             xml = "<person><first>John</first><last>Doe</last></person"
        
        *lxmlbind* makes it easy to define a `Person` object that maps to this structure:
        
            from lxmlbind.api import Base, Property
        
            class Person(Base):
                first = Property("first")
                last = Property("last")
        
        Instances of `Person` wrap an `lxml.etree` and support manipulation of this structure
        through instance attributes:
        
             # create the person from XML
             person = Person.from_xml(xml)
             
             # get the first name attribute
             assert person.first == "John"
             
             # set the last name attribute
             person.last = "Smith"
             
             # print the resulting XML
             print person.to_xml()
             
             # delete the first name entirely
             del person.first
